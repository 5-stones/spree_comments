# Spree Comments

An extension for Spree to allow commenting on different models via the admin ui, currently supports: Orders & Shipments.

Also supports optional comment Types which can be defined per comment-able object (i.e. Order, Shipment, etc) via the admin Configuration tab.

This is really a fork / rename of jderrett/spree-order-comments

Requirements:

* [acts\_as\_commentable](http://github.com/jackdempsey/acts_as_commentable) installed

Notes:

* Comment model and migration included.  You do NOT need to follow the acts\_as\_commentable instructions for script/generate comment
